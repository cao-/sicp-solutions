% Our system treats a variable that appears twice as two different variables...

% Unfortunately, not all expressions can be simplified so that each variable appears only once.  For instance...

% The problem is similar to that of computing the result of an expression of random variables, that is the set of values that the variable can assume with non-zero probability.
