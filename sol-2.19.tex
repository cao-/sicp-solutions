The missing procedures are exactly the primitive operations on list structure:
\begtt\scm
(define no-more? null?)

(define except-first-denomination cdr)

(define first-denomination car)
\endtt

The order of the list `coin-values` do {\em not} affect the result, simply because...\mnote{Add explanation!}\nl
The process carried out will be different, but the result will be the same.
