Basically, it is just a matter of changing the `improve` procedure, besides changing names to the other already defined procedures.
\begtt
(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ (/ x (square guess))
        (* 2 guess))
     3))

(define (cbrt x)
  (cbrt-iter 1.0 x))

(define (cbrt-iter guess x)
  (cbrt-iter2 guess (improve guess x) x))

(define (cbrt-iter2 guess improved-guess x)
  (if (good-enough? guess improved-guess)
      guess
      (cbrt-iter improved-guess x)))

(define (good-enough? guess improved-guess)
  (< (/ (abs (- guess improved-guess)) guess) 0.001))
\endtt
