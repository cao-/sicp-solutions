By experimentation, one can discover that the minimum number of average damps required to compute $n$th roots as a fixed-point search is $\lfloor\log_2 n \rfloor$.  So, assuming that the arithmetic procedures `floor`, `log2` and `expt` are available, we can define the procedure to compute $n$th roots as follows:
\begtt\scm
(define (root n x)
  (fixed-point-of-transform (lambda (y) (/ x (expt y (- n 1))))
                            (repeated average-damp (floor (log2 n)))
                            1.0))
\endtt
