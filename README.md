# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Solutions book (unofficial)
Here you can find my solutions to the exercises of the book [*Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*, Second Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/).

This is a work in progress, I'm updating it as I progress in doing the exercises.

I write in [OpTeX](http://petr.olsak.net/optex/).  I plan to publish a build (a PDF file) whenever I finish a chapter.  You can also produce a build by yourself at any time by running the command:
```bash
optex sicp-solutions.tex
```
