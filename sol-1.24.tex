Since the Fermat test has  $\Theta(\log n)$ growth, we expect the time to test primes near $1,000,000$ to be about twice the time to test primes near $1000$.  Discrepancies may arise for instance because in the estimation we didn't consider the time to compute some other terms like the `random` procedure.
