The problem in defining `if` as a procedure is that it must evaluate all of its three arguments before being applied.
So, when Alyssa calls her `sqrt-iter` procedure, then a new recursive call to `sqrt-iter` with an improved guess is made even if the guess was already good enough.  This means that the procedure will never terminate.
