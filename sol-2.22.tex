The first attempt at defining `square-list` produces the answer list in the reverse order because we keep on taking the first element of `things` and adding it to the front of `result`.  By the way, the first procedure `square-list` has the same structure as the procedure `reverse` defined in the solution to exercise~2.18.

The second attempt doesn't work either, because we don't obtain a list by `cons`ing a list to something that is not a list. 

In order to define `square-list` so that it evolves an iterative process, we must basically reverse the list twice. For instance, if `reverse` is the procedure defined in solution~2.18, we can define `square-list` as follows: 
\begtt\scm
(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
      answer
      (iter (cdr things)
            (cons (square (car things))
                  answer))))
  (reverse (iter items nil)))
\endtt
