In order to modify the procedure `smallest-divisor` as suggested, we need to change the procedure `find-divisor` into:
\begtt\scm
(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor n (next test-divisor)))))
(define (next test-divisor)
  (if (= test-divisor 2)
      3
      (+ test-divisor 2)))
\endtt
When running the timed prime tests one should see that the runtime is reduced, but not as much as to meet the expectation of being twice as fast\fnote{On my machine, using MIT/GNU Scheme Release 12.1, the observed ratio between the old and the new version of the algorithm was approximately~$1.55$, instead of the expected~$2$.}.  This happens because the `next` procedure, besides performing an addition, also has to test the value of its argument, so it is not as fast as the `+` procedure alone. 

In order to almost meet the expectation of halving the times\fnote{In my test I got a ratio of about $1.98$.}, we could alternatively move the conditional check at the beginning and define the `smallest-divisor` procedure as follows:
\begtt\scm
(define (smallest-divisor n) (find-divisor n))
(define (find-divisor n)
  (if (even? n) 2 (find-odd-divisor n 3)))
(define (find-odd-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor-odd n (+ test-divisor 2)))))
\endtt
