Let's simplify the problem by assuming that all numbers are positive.  So, let $X$ be an interval, with both lower and upper bounds positive.  Furthermore, let $c_X$ be the centre of $X$ and let $r_X$ be the ratio between the width and the centre of~$X$. With these quantities defined, the interval $X$ has the following expression:
$$
X = \I[c_X - r_X c_X, c_X + r_X c_X]\hbox{.}
$$

Now, if $Y$ is another analogous interval with expression
$$
Y = \I[c_Y - r_Y c_Y, c_Y + r_Y c_Y]\hbox{,}
$$
we can compute the product of $X$ and $Y$,
$$
\eqalign{
Z &= X \cdot Y \cr 
  &= \I[(c_X - r_X c_X)(c_Y - r_Y c_Y), (c_X + r_X c_X)(c_Y + r_Y c_Y)] \cr 
  &= \I[c_X c_Y - c_X c_Y (r_X + r_Y - r_X r_Y), c_X c_Y + c_X c_Y (r_X + r_Y + r_X r_Y)]\hbox{.}
}
$$

Under the assumption of small percentage tolerances (i.e., small values of $r_X$ and $r_Y$), we can approximate the expression $r_X + r_Y \pm r_X r_Y$ with the simpler expression $r_X + r_Y$.
With this approximation, $Z$ simplifies into
$$
Z\approx \I[c_X c_Y - c_X c_Y (r_X + r_Y), c_X c_Y + c_X c_Y (r_X + r_Y)].
$$

This means that $c_Z = c_X c_Y$ and also that $r_Z = r_X + r_Y$.  So, the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals is the sum of the tolerances of the factors.
