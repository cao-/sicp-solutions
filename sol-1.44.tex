Here is how to define the procedure `smooth`:
\begtt\scm 
(define (smooth f)
  (lambda (x)
    (/ (+ (f (- x dx))
          (f x)
          (f (+ x dx)))
       3)))
\endtt
In order to obtain the procedure that computes the $n$-fold smoothed version of the function computed by a given procedure `f`, we simply evaluate
\begtt\scm
((repeated smooth n) f)
\endtt
